### Extended Road vehicle Pack (ETTV)
Is a plugin that adds Variations to trailer trucks, mostly containing new trailers, e.g. openwagon, Flatbed and closed hopper.

Additionally adds trailer variations such as logos, and real-world company livery, and box trailers with common livery.

For Flatbed Trailers, there are many variations of cargo carried, ranging from wooden cargo, metal pipes, crates, vehicles, etc., There are also light vehicles such as vans.

This plugin is the successor to the ```road vehicle +`` plugin, and is inspired by the Euro truck simulator 2 game and mod.

More variety will come in the future, for now enjoy what is already in the plugin,Good luck and have a nice day.
